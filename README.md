# Xed Line Spacing Plugin

Adds line height tweaking for Xed. This helps increase readability.

## Installation
1. Download `linespacing.plugin` and `linespacing.py` from above.
2. Copy the files to `/usr/lib/*gnu/xed/plugins/`

## Usage
Access Xed's configuration dialog via `Edit | Preferences | Plugins`, and enable the plugin. This adds 3 additional options to the `Tools` menu. Use them to change line spacing.
